/**
 * struct device - The basic device structure
 * @parent:	The device's "parent" device, the device to which it is attached.
 * 		In most cases, a parent device is some sort of bus or host
 * 		controller. If parent is NULL, the device, is a top-level device,
 * 		which is not usually what you want.
 * @p:		Holds the private data of the driver core portions of the device.
 * 		See the comment of the struct device_private for detail.
 * @init_name:	Initial name of the device.
 *
 * ...
 *
 * At the lowest level, every device in a Linux system is represented by an
 * instance of struct device. The device structure contains the information
 * that the device model core needs to model the system. Most subsystems,
 * however, track additional information about the devices they host. As a
 * result, it is rare for devices to be represented by bare device structures;
 * instead, that structure, like kobject structures, is usually embedded within
 * a higher-level representation of the device.
