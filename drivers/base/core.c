/**

 * It is the first half of device_register(), if called by
 * that function, though it can also be called separately, so one
 * may use @dev's fields. In particular, get_device()/put_device()
 * may be used for reference counting of @dev after calling this
 * function.
 *
 * All fields in @dev must be initialized by the caller to 0, except
 * for those explicitly set to some other value.  The simplest
 * approach is to use kzalloc() to allocate the structure containing
 * @dev.
 *
 * NOTE: Use put_device() to give up your reference instead of freeing
 * @dev directly once you have called this function.

 * This adds @dev to the kobject hierarchy via kobject_add(), adds it
 * to the global and sibling lists for the device, then
 * adds it to the other relevant subsystems of the driver model.
 *
 * Do not call this routine or device_register() more than once for
 * any device structure.  The driver model core is not designed to work
 * with devices that get unregistered and then spring back to life.
 * (Among other things, it's very hard to guarantee that all references
 * to the previous incarnation of @dev have been dropped.)  Allocate
 * and register a fresh new struct device instead.
 *
 * NOTE: _Never_ directly free @dev after calling this function, even
 * if it returned an error! Always use put_device() to give up your
